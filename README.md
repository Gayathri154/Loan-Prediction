# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook loan.ipynb contains a step-by-step approach to understanding and modeling the data for accurate loan predictions.

**Key Features**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Visualization of key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Model training using classification algorithms
Evaluation of model performance

**File**
loan.ipynb: Contains the complete analysis and machine learning pipeline

**Tools Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

**How to Run**
1.Clone this repository
2.Open loan.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3.Run the cells step-by-step to follow the analysis

**Objective**
To build a predictive model that helps financial institutions determine whether to approve a loan application based on historical data.
