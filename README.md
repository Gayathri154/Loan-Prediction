# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook loan.ipynb contains a step-by-step approach to understanding and modeling the data for accurate loan predictions.

**Key Features**
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns
2.Data cleaning and preprocessing
3.Visualization of key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
4.Model training using classification algorithms
5.Evaluation of model performance

**File**
loan.ipynb: Contains the complete analysis and machine learning pipeline

**Tools Used**
1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib & Seaborn
5.Scikit-learn
6.Jupyter Notebook

**How to Run**
1.Clone this repository
2.Open loan.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3.Run the cells step-by-step to follow the analysis

**Objective**
To build a predictive model that helps financial institutions determine whether to approve a loan application based on historical data.
